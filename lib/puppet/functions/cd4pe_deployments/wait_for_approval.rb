# @summary Blocks further plan execution until the deployment is approved in CD4PE
#
# Blocks further plan execution until the deployment is approved in CD4PE and takes a lambda that is executed once
# at the start of the wait time. The lambda includes the "url" which is a link to the approval page for the deployment. If
# the max approval window is exceeded (24 hours) or approval is declined, a Bolt::PlanFailure is raised, otherwise a result
# is returned to the user.
Puppet::Functions.create_function(:'cd4pe_deployments::wait_for_approval') do
  # @param environment_name
  # The name of the environment to wait for approval on. Does nothing if the specified environment is not protected.
  # @param block
  #   Takes a block that provides the URL to the deployment's approval page
  # @example Notify Slack users that approval is needed
  #   wait_for_approval("development") |String $url| {
  #     run_task("slack::notify", "#it-ops", "Please review this deployment for approval: ${url}")
  #   }
  # @return [Hash] contains the results of the function
  #   See [README.md]() for information on the CD4PEFunctionResult hash format
  #   * result [Hash]:
  #     * approvalDecision [Enum['APPROVED', 'DECLINED']] whether the deployment was approved or declined
  #   * error [Hash] contains error information if any
